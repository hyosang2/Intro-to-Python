# Chapter 1: Hello World

Welcome to your first Python chapter! This chapter covers the fundamental building blocks of Python programming.

## Print Statements

The first step in programming is to print something on the screen. By convention, we call this step a "print statement":

```python
print("Hello World!")
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World!
```

While being a simple command, print statements are useful in monitoring the status of code execution and debugging.

## Comments

Throughout this guide, you'll see words that are followed after `#`. These words are **comments**. They do not contribute to running the code but are used to describe code.

```python
print("Hello World!")
# I don't do anything.
```

**Output:**
```
Hello World!
```

Comments are essential for:
- Explaining what your code does
- Adding notes for future reference
- Temporarily disabling code without deleting it
- Making your code more readable for others
